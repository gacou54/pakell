# pakell

This project aims to be a small CLI tool to find keywords like
(FIXME, TODO, etc) into specified file or directory. The utilization aims
to be easy. First you have to add your keywords, then look for them.


It is also possible to use pakell as a higher level tool than grep. For example,
the command "pakell lookfor <aWord>" allow you to find a specific word in
the current directory, and "pakell lookfor -p <path> <aWord>" to find a
specific word at a specific path.


## Installation


For now, pakell can only be installed with stack. stack is a program for
developping Haskell projects. Look at the stack website for installation
instructions: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install


Once stack is installed, you need to clone, build and install pakell :

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gacou54/pakell.git
$ cd pakell
$ stack install
```

Now pakell should be installed :)

## Utilization

pakell initialize a config file in the .config directory, pakell.conf.
It should be empty at the first utilization. Keywords in there are the ones that
pakell will look for when parsing file/directory.

To add a keyword:

```bash
$ pakell add TODO
```

You just added a new keyword. You can look for it in a file or directory
that way:


```bash
$ pakell look <directoryOrFilePath>
```
or (l is an alias for look command)

```bash
$ pakell l <directoryOrFilePath>
```

or to look in current directory

```bash
$ pakell
```

To remove a keyword:

```bash
$ pakell remove TODO
```

To list current keywords:

```bash
$ pakell list
```

To remove all keywords:

```bash
$ pakell clear
```

Notes
* You can recursively parse directories with the -r option.
* Some command don't need a specified path because it parse the current directory, but you can speficy a path with the -p <aPath> option, where <aPath> is your path like home/
* By default, hidden file/directory are not parsed. But you can allow it by -d option

### NOTE
IN DEVELOPMENT.
* This is a new project and may change. By now pakell works well on my computer, but I have no garanty that it will work everywhere


### TODO

* Add fonctionnalities
* Exception management: I developped this to work on my system.
        I don't know if pakell works well everywhere.
        For example I use a 256 color terminal, which is not the case for
        everybody.
