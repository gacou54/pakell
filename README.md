# pakell

This project aims to be a small CLI tool to find some comments notes like
(FIXME, TODO, etc) into specified file or directory.

## Installation


For now, pakell can only be installed with stack. stack is a program for
developping Haskell project. Look at the stack website for installation
instruction: https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install


Once stack is installed, you need to clone, build and install pakell :

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gacou54/pakell.git
$ cd pakell
$ stack install
```

Now pakell should be installed :)


NOTE : IN DEVELOPMENT.
       This project has just been started. Also, this is my first Haskell
       project. Once functional, this project will probably have to be reworked.


### TODO

* Add fonctionnalities
* Exception management: I developped this to work on my system.
        I don't know if pakell works well anywhere.
        For example I use a 256 color terminal, which is not the case for
        everybody.
