# pakell

This project aims to be a small CLI tool to find some comments notes like
(FIXME, TODO, etc) into specified file or directory.

NOTE : IN DEVELOPMENT.
       This project has just been started. Also, this is my first Haskell
       project. Once functional, this project will probably have to be reworked.
