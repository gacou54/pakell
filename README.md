# pakell

This project aims to be a small CLI tool to find some comments notes like
(FIXME, TODO, etc) into specified file or directory.

NOTE : IN DEVELOPMENT.
       This project has just been started. Also, this is my first Haskell
       project. Once functional, this project will probably have to be reworked.

       Also, at the begining pakell will only work with an specified file, and
       not with a specified directory
