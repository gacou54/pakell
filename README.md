# pakell

This project aims to be a small CLI tool to find some comments notes like
(FIXME, TODO, etc) into specified file or directory.

NOTE : IN DEVELOPMENT.
       This project has just been started. Also, this is my first Haskell
       project. Once functional, this project will probably have to be reworked.


       TODO
            - Directory parsing (only file is supported at this moment)
            - General group <keyWord> search, I think there should be an add/remove
                function to add/remove <keyWord> in general search
            - Exception management: I developped this to work on my system.
                I don't know if pakell works well anywhere.
                For example I use a 256 color terminal, which is not the case for
                everybody.
